# LazyCMS
A very simple CMS that can edit a single JSON file with text labels.

### Goals

Simple and easy, no unnecessary features. This is supposed to be used for very small projects
where all that is needed is some very basic content management and nothing fancy.

### Features

- Content can be split into into sections (with a global section for shared content)
- Mechanism to generate output files with replaced text labels
- Script to retrieve text labels from source files (similar to gettext)

### Upcoming Features

- Mechanism to render output files with replaced text labels on the fly
