# LazyCMS
A very simple CMS that can edit a single JSON file with text labels.

Goals
=====

Simple and easy, no unnecessary features. This is supposed to be used for very small projects
where all that is needed is some very basic content management and nothing fancy.

Upcoming Features
=================

- Script to retrieve text labels from source files (similar to gettext)
- Mechanism to generate output files with replaced text labels
- Mechanism to render output files with replaced text labels on the fly
